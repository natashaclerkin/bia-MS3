# Bia.ie

## Code Institute MS3 Project in Backend Development 
The brief was to develop a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain. Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members. This website is created for educational purposes.

# Project Overview

## [Bia.ie Online Cookbook](http://bia-ms3.herokuapp.com/)


![alt text](wireframes/amiresponsive.PNG "Am I Responsive Image") 

[View website](http://bia-ms3.herokuapp.com/) 
 
[Bia.ie](http://bia-ms3.herokuapp.com/) is an online cookbook and community for Irish food-lovers. For any non-native Irish speakers who may be slightly confused re the website name, 'bia' is Gaeilge for the word 'food'! 

The idea for Bia was conceived in the midst of the Covid 19 Pandemic where many industries became decimated as a result of the virus and life as we once knew it changed forever. 
With the nation ordered to remain socially distanced from one another and stay confined in their homes, people turned to the two things that were constant in this new normal: food and the internet!
Enter the avalanche of tutorials and baking recipes with everyone claiming to hold the ultimate banana bread recipe!
The challenge? To fulfil this new demand for online recipes and create a community around it. Also, to boost the economy by supporting struggling Irish businesses. Bia was the obvious solution. 
Unlike any other online cookbook, the website showcases recipes utilising locally-produced ingredients & products and allows the promotion of these homegrown food producers by displaying ingredients or brands with direct links to their website.
Users of Bia make use of the site by sharing their own recipes with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to recipes provided by all other members all whilst promoting local Irish food businesses.

My own goals as a developer creating this project were to: 
- Develop a web application that allowed users to store and easily access cooking recipes. 
- Create an app which is highly accessibile, responsive and simplistic in design.
- Create the backend code and frontend forms allowing users to add new recipes to the site, view them, edit them and delete them using CRUD operations.
- Create the backend and frontend functionality for users to locate recipes based on the recipe's fields providing full search functionality on the site.
- Provide these search results in a manner that is visually appealing and user-friendly.

# UX


## Goals

### External userâ€™s goal:
- Locate - To easily find inspiration for a future meal or locate a specific recipe based on a past meal or from a personal wishlist. To find recipes from other members by: meal type, by specific ingredients and by dietary requirement. 
- Share - To share knowledge from a homemade recipe or a successful recipe used in the past. To share by adding recipes to the community and providing details by ingredients, cook & prep time, dietary requirements relevant to the recipes and being able to edit and delete them when I no longer want to share with the community.
- Create - To create a list of recipes and store as a customised online cookback to refer back to in the future.

### Site owner's goal:
- Provide a simple, easy to use online cookbook and space where food-lovers can find and share recipes using Irish ingredients with the community. 
- Promote homegrown irish food producers online.
- To benefit from the collection of the recipes in the community to operate as a content incubator for the website.
- Earn revenue through affiliate marketing by directing potential customers towards featured food producers websites. 

### Brand owner's goal:
- Create awareness for the brand on the website.
- Gain potential new customers.
- Show versatility of products by creating recipes on the site.


## User Stories

As a returning user, I would like to:

- The ability to add, edit or remove recipe categories so that I can keep the categories relevant to what users are searching for
- The ability to add, edit or remove brands as required to maintain relevance between the recipes and brands currently in the community.
- View the amount of clicks from the featured business page and linked ingredient URLs so that I can gauge potential success of affiliate marketing. 



## Design

### Typography
I wanted to use [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat#about) for the headings and [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans/#about) as a supporting body font to achieve the desired clean-cut image.

### Icons
Font Awesome icons has been used for this project.

### Color Scheme
The Bia brand monochrome colour scheme was implemented along with pops of green to reflect the Irish fresh products represented throughout the site.
I wanted to keep the color palette simplistic and clean to allow for the imagery from the recipes to stand out and inject the site with colour.
However the colour red is used for error messages for the Signup and Login pages to highlight a warning to the user.

I ended up creating and using the below palette once it had passed rigorous Accessibility testing in **A11y's Color Contrast Accessibility Validator**.

## Wireframes

The folder contains [Wireframes](wireframes/wireframes.pdf "Bia Wireframes") including mockups of the homepage, an individual recipe page, submit recipe page, featured business page and account creation page designed at the beginning of the project for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. I have also included the projected [sitemap](wireframes/bia-site-map.png "Bia Sitemap") and data [schema](wireframes/schema.PNG "Bia Schema").
**Please note the finalised project contains slight variations to the original wireframes**

# Information Architecture

[^ Back To Top ](#contents)

## Database Choice
In order to fulfil the project requirements, the NoSQL database MongoDB was utilised to store the data.

This non-relational database structure suits Bia as there are only a few relationships between the various collections. 

## Data Modeling
The project currently relies on five database collections:

#### Categories collection

|**Key**|**Type**|**Notes**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|_id|ObjectId||
|category_name|string||

#### Recipe collection

|**Key**|**Type**|**Notes**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|_id|ObjectId||
|title|string||
|category_name|string||
|recipe_description|string||
|image_url|string||
|serves|Array||
|prep|string||
|cooks|string||
|difficulty|string||
|ingredient_name|string||
|instructions|string||
|date_added|string||
|username|string||


#### Users collection

|**Key**|**Type**|**Notes**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|_id|ObjectId||
|username|string||
|password|string||
|email|string||


#### Businesses collection

|**Key**|**Type**|**Notes**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|_id|ObjectId||
|business_name|string||
|business_description|string||
|business_url|string||


#### Ingredients collection

|**Key**|**Type**|**Notes**|
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
|_id|ObjectId||
|ingredient_name|string||
|business_url|string||

# Credits
I took inspiration from the following sources however I did implement my own custom code with each snippet also:

- I undertook a significant amount of research into backend development in preparation for the project. As well as the Code Institute's walkthrough tutorials by [Tim Nelson](https://github.com/TravelTimN) which provided great guidance for the project, I also watched a significant amount of Youtube tutorials notably [Corey Schafer](https://www.youtube.com/user/schafer5)
