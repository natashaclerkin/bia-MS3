# Bia.ie

## Code Institute MS3 Project in Backend Development 
The brief was to develop a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain. Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members. This website is created for educational purposes.

## [Bia.ie Online Cookbook](https://LINK.URL) 


WEBSITE IMAGE/BIE. IE LOGO

 
Bia.ie is an online cookbook and community for Irish food-lovers.  
For any non-native Irish speakers who may be slightly confused re the website name, 'bia' is Gaeilge for the word 'food'! 
The idea for Bia.ie was conceived in the midst of the Covid 19 Pandemic where many industries became decimated as a result of the virus and life as we once knew it changed forever. 
With the nation ordered to remain socially distanced from one another and stay confined in their homes, people turned to the two things that were constant in this new normal: food and the internet!
Enter the avalanche of tutorials and baking recipes with everyone claiming to hold the ultimate banana bread recipe!
The challenge? To fulfil this new demand for online recipes and create a community around it. Also, to boost the economy by supporting struggling Irish businesses. Bia.ie was the obvious solution. 
Unlike any other online cookbook, the website showcases recipes utilising locally-produced ingredients & products and allows the promotion of these homegrown food producers by displaying individual ingredients as direct links to their website.
Users of Bia.ie make use of the site by sharing their own recipes with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to recipes provided by all other members all whilst promoting local Irish food businneses.

My own goals as a developer creating this project were to: 
- Develop a web application that allowed users to store and easily access cooking recipes. 
- Create an app which is highly accessibile, responsive and simplistic in design.
- Create the backend code and frontend forms allowing users to add new recipes to the site, view them, edit them and delete them using CRUD operations.
- Create the backend and frontend functionality for users to locate recipes based on the recipe's fields providing full search functionality on the site.
- Provide these search results in a manner that is visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Goals

### External userâ€™s goal:
- To easily find inspiration for a future meal or locate a specific recipe based on a past meal or from a personal wishlist. To find recipes from other members by: meal type, by specific ingredients and by dietary requirement. 
- To share knowledge from a homemade recipe or a successful recipe used in the past. To share by adding recipes to the community and providing details by ingredients, cook & prep time, dietary requirements relevant to the recipes and being able to edit and delete them when I no longer want to share with the community.
- To create a list of recipes and store as a customised online cookback to refer back to in the future.

### Site owner's goal:

- View all the recipes I have stored in a specific area so that I can review my current collection at any time and refer back to them when needed.
- Create a new recipe providing necessary details so that I can share knowledge from a homemade/successful recipe used in the past with the community.
- Edit one of my current recipes so that I can improve the recipe for other members or users.
- Remove one of my current recipes so I that I can choose to no longer share it with the community.
- To have access to all recipes provided by the community so that I can view content from other members.
- To browse recipes from other members so that I can get inspiration for future meals based on meal type, specific ingredients used and by dietary requirement. 

### Business/Admin Users

As a business/admin user, I would like to do all of the above as well as:
- The ability to edit or remove recipes created by users so that I can vet the content and ensure it's appropriate for users.
- The ability to add, edit or remove recipe categories so that I can keep the categories relevant to what users are searching for
- Edit the linked ingredient URLs so that they divert to the correct business website.
- View the amount of clicks from the featured business page and linked ingredient URLs so that I can gauge potential success of affiliate marketing. 


## Design

### Typography
The following fonts were used:

 was used for the navigation elements. was used for headings. Regular was used for the general text.
(I wanted to use `'Montserrat'` so I used this font along with `sans-serif;` as a backup font to maintain the clean-cut image.)


## Icons
Materialize icons has been used for this project.

### Color Scheme
The Bia.ie brand monochrome colour scheme was implemented along with pops of green to reflect the Irish fresh products represented throughout the site.
I wanted to keep the color palette simplistic and clean to allow for the imagery from the recipes to stand out and inject the site with colour.
However the colour red is used for error messages for the Signup and Login pages to highlight a warning to the user.

I ended up creating and using the below palette once it had passed rigorous Accessibility testing in **A11y's Color Contrast Accessibility Validator**.
