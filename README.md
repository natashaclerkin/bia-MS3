# Bia.ie

## Code Institute MS3 Project in Backend Development 
The brief was to develop a full-stack site that allows users to manage a common dataset about a particular domain. Users make use of the site to share their own data with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to the data provided by all other members. This website is created for educational purposes.

# Project Overview

## [Bia.ie Online Cookbook](http://bia-ms3.herokuapp.com/)


![Am I Responsive Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/nclerkin/image/upload/v1620756623/amiresponsive_urcfgx.png "Am I Responsive Image") 

[View website](http://bia-ms3.herokuapp.com/) 
 
[Bia.ie](http://bia-ms3.herokuapp.com/) is an online cookbook and community for Irish food-lovers. For any non-native Irish speakers who may be slightly confused re the website name, 'bia' is Gaeilge for the word 'food'! 

The idea for Bia was conceived in the midst of the Covid 19 Pandemic where many industries became decimated as a result of the virus and life as we once knew it changed forever. 
With the nation ordered to remain socially distanced from one another and stay confined in their homes, people turned to the two things that were constant in this new normal: food and the internet!
Enter the avalanche of tutorials and baking recipes with everyone claiming to hold the ultimate banana bread recipe!
The challenge? To fulfil this new demand for online recipes and create a community around it. Also, to boost the economy by supporting struggling Irish businesses. Bia was the obvious solution. 
Unlike any other online cookbook, the website showcases recipes utilising locally-produced ingredients & products and allows the promotion of these homegrown food producers by displaying ingredients or brands with direct links to their website.
Users of Bia make use of the site by sharing their own recipes with the community, and benefit from having convenient access to recipes provided by all other members all whilst promoting local Irish food businesses.

My own goals as a developer creating this project were to: 
- Develop a web application that allowed users to store and easily access cooking recipes. 
- Create an app which is highly accessibile, responsive and simplistic in design.
- Create the backend code and frontend forms allowing users to add new recipes to the site, view them, edit them and delete them using CRUD operations.
- Create the backend and frontend functionality for users to locate recipes based on the recipe's fields providing full search functionality on the site.
- Provide these search results in a manner that is visually appealing and user-friendly.

# UX


## Goals

To share by adding recipes to the community and providing details by ingredients, cook & prep time, dietary requirements relevant to the recipes and being able to edit and delete them when I no longer want to share with the community.
- Create: To create a list of recipes and store as a customised online cookback to refer back to in the future.

### Site owner's goal:

## Design

![Data Success messaging](https://res.cloudinary.com/nclerkin/image/upload/v1620829925/data-success_qvjnaj.png "Data Success messaging")

### Typography
I wanted to use [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat#about) for the headings and [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans/#about) as a supporting body font to achieve the desired clean-cut image.

### Icons
Font Awesome icons has been used for this project.

### Color Scheme
The Bia brand monochrome colour scheme was implemented along with pops of green to reflect the Irish fresh products represented throughout the site.
I wanted to keep the color palette simplistic and clean to allow for the imagery from the recipes to stand out and inject the site with colour.
However the colour red is used for error messages for the Signup and Login pages to highlight a warning to the user.

I ended up creating and using the below palette once it had passed rigorous Accessibility testing in **A11y's Color Contrast Accessibility Validator**.

## Wireframes

This folder contains [Wireframes](wireframes/wireframes.pdf "Bia Wireframes") including mockups of the homepage, an individual recipe page, submit recipe page, featured business page and account creation page designed at the beginning of the project for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. I have also included the projected [sitemap](https://res.cloudinary.com/nclerkin/image/upload/v1620756692/bia-sitemap_iqzi13.png "Bia Sitemap") and data [schema](https://res.cloudinary.com/nclerkin/image/upload/v1620758330/schema_ufevtk.png "Bia Schema").
**Please note the finalised project contains slight variations to the original wireframes**

# Information Architecture

![Bia Sitemap](https://res.cloudinary.com/nclerkin/image/upload/v1620756692/bia-sitemap_iqzi13.png "Bia Sitemap")


## Database Choice
In order to fulfil the project requirements, the NoSQL database MongoDB was utilised to store the data.

This non-relational database structure suits Bia as there are only a few relationships between the various collections. 

![Mongo DB Bia Collections](https://res.cloudinary.com/nclerkin/image/upload/v1620782460/mongodb_s0znhx.png "Mongo DB Bia Collections")

# Testing
The Testing process has been documented in this [testing.md file](TESTING.md "TESTING.md File")

# Deployment

## Local Deployment

### Requirements:
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org) 
- [PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) 
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) 
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)


### How to clone Bia:

![Local Deployment](https://res.cloudinary.com/nclerkin/image/upload/v1620783586/deploy_w39xv3.png "Local Deployment")
1. Log in to GitHub and go to [this repository](https://github.com/natashaclerkin/bia-MS3).
2. At the top of the repository, select **Code** and copy the **Clone URL**.
3. In your IDE, open a Terminal window and change to the directory where you want the cloned directory to be made and type `git clone` and paste in `https://github.com/natashaclerkin/bia-MS3.git`.
4. Click enter and the project will be created and cloned locally.

### Working with the local copy:

1. Install all the project dependencies from the terminal window of your IDE by typing: pip3 install -r requirements.txt.
2. Register or login to your [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) account to create a database. First create a cluster, then a database and the four collections as displayed [here](https://res.cloudinary.com/nclerkin/image/upload/v1620758330/schema_ufevtk.png).
3. Create an env.py file to contain the environment variables, which should include the following:

```console
import os

os.environ.setdefault("IP", "0.0.0.0")
os.environ.setdefault("PORT", "5000")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "**secret key goes here**")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_URI", "**mongo uri goes here**")
os.environ.setdefault("MONGO_DBNAME", "**database name goes here**")
```
4. Create a .gitignore file in the root directory of the project and add the env.py to the .gitignore file to prevent the environment variables being made public.
5. Type `python3 app.py` into the terminal to run the app locally. 



## Heroku Deployment

1. Set up local workspace for Heroku by typing `pip3 freeze -- local > requirements.txt` into the terminal to inform Heroku of the files required and then `python app.py > Procfile` to setup the Procfile. 
2. Set up [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) by signing in or registering an account to create the app. To create the app, you must select the local region and the app must have a unique name.
3. Link the app to the GitHub repository by going to the **Deploy** tab in the main app menu, search for your correct repository and select to connect.
4. Add the corresponding Config Variables by selecting **Config Vars** and click on **Reveal Config Vars**. Input the variables from the IDE created in earlier steps to the **Settings** tab:

|**Key**|**Value**|
|:-----|:-----|
|IP|`0.0.0.0`|
|PORT|`5000`|
|SECRET_KEY|`secret key goes here`|
|MONGO_URI|`mongo uri goes here`|
|MONGO_DBNAME|`database name goes here`|

5. Push the requirements.txt and Procfile to repository.
```console
$ git add requirements.txt
$ git commit -m "Add requirements.txt"

$ git add Procfile 
$ git commit -m "Add Procfile"
```

6. Go back to the **Deploy** tab and under **Automatic deploys** select **Enable Automatic Deploys** and under **Manual deploy**, select **master** and click **Deploy Branch**.
7. Once the app has completed the build from Github using the required packages, click **Open app** to reveal the live URL.
